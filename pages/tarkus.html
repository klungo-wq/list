    Has the dawn ever seen your eyes?
    Have the days made you so unwise?
    Realize, you are
    Had you talked to the winds of time
    Then you'd know how the waters rhyme
    Taste of wine
    How can you know where you've been?
    In time you'll see the sign
    And realize your sin
    Will you know how the seed is sown?
    All your time has been overgrown
    Never known
    Have you walked on the stones of years?
    When you speak, is it you that hears?
    Are your ears full?
    You can't hear anything at all
    The preacher said a prayer
    Save every single hair on his head
    He's dead
    The minister of hate had just arrived too late to be spared
    Who cared?
    The weaver in the web that he made
    The pilgrim wandered in
    Commiting every sin that he could
    So good
    The cardinal of grief was set in his belief he'd saved
    From the grave
    The weaver in the web that he made
    The high priest took a blade
    To bless the ones that prayed
    And all obeyed
    The messenger of fear is slowly growing, nearer to the time
    A sign
    The weaver in the web that he made
    A bishops rings a bell
    A cloak of darkness fell across the ground
    Without a sound
    The silent choir sing and in their silence
    Bring jaded sound, harmonic ground
    The weaver in the web that he made
    Clear the battlefield and let me see
    All the profit from our victory
    You talk of freedom, starving children fall
    Are you deaf when you hear the season's call?
    Were you there to watch the earth be scorched?
    Did you stand beside the spectral torch?
    Know the leaves of sorrow turned their face
    Scattered on the ashes of disgrace
    Every blade is sharp; the arrows fly
    Where the victims of your armies lie
    Where the blades of brass and arrows reign
    Then there will be no sorrow
    Be no pain
